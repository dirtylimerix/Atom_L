## Scripts

The _scripts_ subdirectory and _tools_ subdirectory are not part of the actual device tree. _tools_ contains the latest _imjtool_ and _repo_ binaries for convenience, and the _scripts_ subdirectory contains a number of helpful bash scripts for doing new builds, updating a build, deploying a release to a device, etc. Although they should work in any Linux environment, these scripts were only tested under my personal Ubuntu 18.04 environment, and so I make no guarantees about them working for you, but they contain some documentation and good examples of the workflows needed to use this repository.
